Project: Customer Segmentation and Analysis using K-Means Clustering with Python

Objective:

The objective of this project is to perform customer segmentation and analysis using K-Means clustering with Python.Using clustering techniques, companies can identify the several segments of customers allowing them to target the potential user base.

Key Activities:

A.Loading and Exploring Data:

1.The dataset is loaded into a Pandas DataFrame.

2.Basic exploratory data analysis is performed, including examining the first five rows, checking the data shape, and reviewing data information for insights.

B.Data Preprocessing:

1.Missing values are checked and found to be absent.

2. The relevant columns for clustering (Annual Income and Spending Score) are selected.

C.Determining Optimal Clusters:

1.The "Elbow Method" is employed to determine the optimal number of clusters.

2. The Within-Cluster-Sum-of-Squares (WCSS) is plotted against the number of clusters.
